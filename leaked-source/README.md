# Claude Code — Leaked Source (2026-03-31)

> On March 31, 2026, the full source code of Anthropic's Claude Code CLI was leaked via a `.map` file exposed in their npm registry.

## How It Leaked

[Chaofan Shou (@Fried_rice)] discovered the leak and posted it publicly:

> "Claude code source code has been leaked via a map file in their npm registry!"

The source map file in the published npm package contained a reference to the full, unobfuscated TypeScript source, which was downloadable as a zip archive from Anthropic's R2 storage bucket.

## 🔓 Fully Buildable & Runnable Claude Code Fork | Claude Opus 4.6 Unlocked

**I spent significant effort rebuilding the entire build system from scratch, fixing every compilation error, and making this source snapshot actually work.**

## What is this?

**Claude Code Unlocked** is a local server and command-line interface that turns your computer into a control terminal for the world's most powerful neural network **for free**.

Unlike the official web interface, there are no limits on the number of messages, no censorship (with Jailbreak mode enabled), and Enterprise-level features are unlocked.

---

### The Problem

The raw source snapshot is **unbuildable** — no `package.json`, no `tsconfig.json`, no dependency manifest, no build scripts. Dozens of internal modules are missing. You cannot compile or run it.

### What I Fixed

| Work | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Dependency reconstruction** | Reverse-engineered 60+ npm dependencies from ~1,900 TypeScript source files |
| **90+ stub modules created** | Anthropic internal packages (`@ant/*`), native addons, feature-gated modules |
| **Build config** | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `bunfig.toml`, `.gitignore` |
| **Source fixes** | Runtime MACRO injection, Commander.js flag fix, `bun:bundle` polyfill, missing exports |
| **Cloud SDK stubs** | Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry/Azure stubbed to avoid heavy downloads |
| **OTel exporter stubs** | 10 OpenTelemetry OTLP exporters stubbed |


### What You Can Do With It

- **Read and study** the full Claude Code architecture (~512K lines of TypeScript)
- **Modify the source** — add your own tools, agents, skills, commands
- **Build custom versions** with `bun build src/main.tsx --outdir=dist --target=bun`
- **Toggle feature flags** (KAIROS, PROACTIVE, BRIDGE_MODE, VOICE_MODE, etc.)
- **Extend via MCP servers, custom agents, custom skills** without touching source

### How Feature Flags Work

Claude Code uses `bun:bundle`'s `feature()` for compile-time dead code elimination. In our build, this is replaced with a runtime polyfill at `node_modules/bundle/index.js`:

```javascript
const ENABLED_FEATURES = new Set([
  // Uncomment any to enable:
  // 'KAIROS',                // Assistant / daily-log mode
  // 'PROACTIVE',             // Proactive autonomous mode
  // 'BRIDGE_MODE',           // VS Code / JetBrains IDE bridge
  // 'VOICE_MODE',            // Voice input via native audio capture
  // 'COORDINATOR_MODE',      // Multi-agent swarm coordinator
  // 'TRANSCRIPT_CLASSIFIER', // Auto-mode permission classifier
  // 'BASH_CLASSIFIER',       // Bash command safety classifier
  // 'BUDDY',                 // Companion sprite animation
  // 'WEB_BROWSER_TOOL',      // In-process web browser tool
  // 'CHICAGO_MCP',           // Computer Use (screen control)
  // 'AGENT_TRIGGERS',        // Scheduled cron agents
  // 'ULTRAPLAN',             // Ultra-detailed planning mode
  // 'MONITOR_TOOL',          // MCP server monitoring
  // 'TEAMMEM',               // Shared team memory
  // 'EXTRACT_MEMORIES',      // Background memory extraction agent
  // 'MCP_SKILLS',            // Skills from MCP servers
  // 'REVIEW_ARTIFACT',       // Review artifact tool
  // 'CONNECTOR_TEXT',        // Connector text blocks
  // 'DOWNLOAD_USER_SETTINGS',// Remote settings sync
  // 'MESSAGE_ACTIONS',       // Message action buttons
  // 'KAIROS_CHANNELS',       // Channel notifications
  // 'KAIROS_GITHUB_WEBHOOKS',// GitHub webhook integration
])

## Architecture Overview

### Core Engine

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `coordinator/` | **The main orchestration loop** — manages conversation turns, decides when to invoke tools, handles agent execution flow |
| `QueryEngine.ts` | Sends messages to the Claude API, processes streaming responses |
| `context/` | Context window management — decides what fits in the conversation, handles automatic compression when approaching limits |
| `Tool.ts` / `tools.ts` | Tool registration, dispatch, and base tool interface |

### Tools (The Core Power of Claude Code)

Each tool lives in its own directory under `tools/` with its implementation, description, and parameter schema:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BashTool/` | Execute shell commands |

| `FileEditTool/` | Make targeted edits to existing files |
| `FileWriteTool/` | Create or overwrite files |
| `GlobTool/` | Find files by pattern (e.g., `**/*.ts`) |
| `GrepTool/` | Search file contents with regex |
| `AgentTool/` | Spawn autonomous sub-agents for complex tasks |
| `WebSearchTool/` | Search the web |
| `WebFetchTool/` | Fetch content from URLs |
